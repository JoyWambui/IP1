    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Joy Wambui.</p>
    <p>I am an ongoing software development PREP student at Moringa School in the MPFT39 cohort. I  presently chose to pursue programming and opted to join a software development class as I wait to join university because it has always been something that has interested me. Learning why and how things work the way they do is part and parcel of who I am. My interest was further piqued when I would watch my sister create beautiful and responsive websites from scratch and wanted to learn how she did it. </p>
    <p>I completed my A-Level studies last year and currently have no work-experience aside from volunteering at various organizations while in school.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to:
      <ol type="I">
        <li>Learning to play the ukelele.</li>
        <li>Creative and reflective Writing.</li>
        <li>Crafting DIY projects.</li>
        <li>Singing.</li>
        <li>Learning new things.</li>
        <li>Gardening.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
