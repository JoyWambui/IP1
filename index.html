      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Joy Wambui.</p>
      <p>I am an ongoing software development PREP student at <strong>Moringa School</strong> in the <em>MPFT39</em> cohort. I  presently chose to pursue programming and opted to join a software development class as I wait to join university because it has always been something that has interested me. <span>Learning why and how things work the way they do is part and parcel of who I am.</span> My interest was further piqued when I would watch my sister create beautiful and responsive websites from scratch and wanted to learn how she did it. </p>
      <p>I completed my A-Level studies last year and currently have no work-experience aside from volunteering at various organizations while in school.</p>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to:
        <ol  id="hobbies" type="I">
          <li>Learning to play the ukelele.</li>
          <li>Creative and reflective Writing.</li>
          <li>Crafting DIY projects.</li>
          <li>Singing.</li>
          <li>Learning new things.</li>
          <li>Gardening.</li>
        </ol>
